        <h3 class="intro job"> A Task List for Groups (Mobile Prototype) </h3>
        <h4 class="intro"> Fall 2017 </h4>
        <p><b>Context</b></p>
        <p>A todo app allows a user to create groups with his or her friends and add tasks inside that will be shared to everyone in the group. The user also has the option to view all tasks created by him or shared with him, ordered by priority.</p>
        <p>Class: Programming User Interfaces</p>
        <p><b>User Goals</b></p>
        <p>The goal of a user is to create and share tasks with his or her friends in the most efficient, intuitive way possible. The targeted use of the app is aimed toward people who wish to share a to-do list with a specific group of people. It is focused toward more permanent groups, groups that won’t change after just one task; for example, home, work, or project groups. The todo can help people that live together to easily organize chores and tasks that will be shared to the rest of the household.</p>
        <p><b>Process</b></p>
        <p>To start, I downloaded other todo mobile and web applications and searched for their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Paper Prototypes</p>
        <img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/ifyaCAIQTKunklHygWNTIw.png" style="width: 75%">
        <p></p>
        <p>User Studies</p>
        <p>I recruited colleagues and friends to conduct task analyses using the paper prototype. The main takeaways I discovered were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To add a complete/done button after creating a new group or a new task (make it more obvious how to “complete” a task)</li>
            <li>Show priority in the task list</li>
            <li>Change focus to be more group-centered rather than task centered</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Design Considerations</b></p>
        <p>I mainly took into consideration the ease in which a user should be able to create and share a task. I kept the action of adding a task to a group simple, allowing a user to name the task, select its priority, and choose which groups to share the task to. I made the background of the app a gradient of blue and green as it matches the color of the social connection icons (contacts list, Facebook, email). It is a subtle, calming color that does not affect the readability of the text on the screen.</p>
        <p><b>Design Rationale</b></p>
        <p>I believed that it would be more organized for tasks to be placed in set groups “pages” instead of having members being assigned to a task each time. By doing so, it easily allows the user to separate out which tasks are for what group (i.e. family, work, etc), instead of viewing a gigantic list of unorganized tasks (the user would have to click into a task to view to whom it was shared with.) Also, as of now, navigating through the app works through a series of clicks. However, the one feature I would also want to be done through swiping would be the deletion feature. The majority of apps today with listed items may also be deleted through swiping left and seeing a delete option on that item similar to what I have designed to happen if the trash icon is clicked. But just in case, I would want to incorporate both the swipe and the trash icon. While the swipe is more intuitive and efficient for knowledgeable users, it is not nearly as intuitive for new users as the trash can icon.</p>
        <p><b>Product</b></p>
        <p>The final product was a high-fidelity prototype created with Sketch and InVision.</p>
