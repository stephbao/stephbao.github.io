        <h4 class="intro"> Summer 2017 </h4>
        <p><b>Context</b></p>
        <p>I worked as a Research Intern at the Center for Machine Learning and Health in Pittsburgh, PA. This study was as a follow-up to a previous study conducted by my researcher, Min Kyung Lee.</p>
        <p><b>Goals</b></p>
        <p>Understand the differences behind peopleâ€™s perceptions of algorithmic decisions and human decisions, specifically with human-in-the-loop (HitL) scenarios.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Study related papers</li>
        <li>Survey design and analysis</li>
        <li>Write a research paper</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Process</b></p>
        <p>The first step was to gather related research papers to decide the direction of the study. The original research paper that this study was based on compared only the perceptions of algorithmic decisions vs human decisions. The results from the study found that while people believed algorithmic decisions are less error-prone and unbiased, they are unable to understand special cases and external factors. We decided to focus on a combination of the two (HitL).</p>
        <p>The next step was to design the study. We chose a 4x5 study with four different scenarios (assignment, evaluation, hiring, and scheduling) and five combinations of data analyzers and decision makers (algorithm only, three HitL combinations, human only).</p>
        <p>We then began designing the survey. We were able to adapt the descriptions and questions from the first survey. However, we went through multiple iterations on the wordings as people found it difficult to differentiate between two of the three HitL scenarios. Eventually, we were able to secure a satisfactory accuracy rate.</p>
        <p>After we received ~1600 responses, I cleansed and organized the data. I used Python to parse through the CSV file of responses to create a readable data table. Afterwards, I used SAS JMP to perform the statistical analyses on the quantitative responses. We then performed qualitative analysis on the open-ended answers by creating a coding scheme based on the responses and manually coded each of the responses.</p>
        <p><b>Results</b></p>
        <p>We discovered for the assignment task requiring mechanical skills, decision maker had no effect. As tasks required more human skills, algorithmic and human-in- the-loop decisions were perceived increasingly more negatively than human decisions. For scheduling, the human analysis-based algorithmic decision was perceived as positively as the human decision in all aspects. For hiring, some human-in- the-loop decisions were perceived as more fair and trustworthy than algorithmic decisions, but less than human decisions. For evaluation, all human-in- the-loop decisions were perceived similarly to the algorithmic decisions.</p>
