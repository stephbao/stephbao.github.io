        <h4 class="intro"> Fall 2016 </h4>
        <p><b>Context</b></p>
        <p>The goal was to create a product that could be used by streamers or viewers of Twitch.Tv, a live streaming video platform. We had an interdisciplinary group of 6 members. I took a user research and design role by identifying the problems, proposing a solution, and working on and user testing the interface.</p>
        <p>Class: Special Topics: Twitch Plays Game Design</p>
        <p><b>Concept</b></p>
        <p>The problem we decided work on was: How can we help the streamer create a better experience for the audience? From this starting point we decided to focus on the chat and how to generate analytics from the chat that the streamer can go through quickly to learn about the animosity and topics the audience was chatting about.</p>
        <p>The main issue we faced was in presenting the data to the streamer in a concise manner so that they would be able to quickly understand what is going on. Streamers often play games that require a the majority of the player’s attention span, so it is difficult for them to read or interact with the chat while they are playing. We then came up with the idea of simply conveying the emotion of the chat. By doing so, the streamer would be able to at a glance, understanding the general feel of his or her chat.</p>
        <p><b>Product</b></p>
        <p>Our final product was a Google Chrome extension. We used the AlchemyLanguage API to conduct sentimental analysis on the chat. Our API analyzed the chat for five emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. The interface of our extension displays the percentage happiness in the chat and the percentage of the most dominant negative emotion.</p>
