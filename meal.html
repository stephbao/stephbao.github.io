        <h4 class="intro"> Fall 2017 </h4>
        <p><b>Context</b></p>
        <p>My project group was assigned to recreate an aspect of the lunch experience at Carnegie Mellon. Over a period of three months, we conducted: stakeholder interviews, sequence-flow models, cultural models, affinity diagrams, visioning, storyboarding, speed dating, survey design, and survey analysis in order to create a solution.</p>
        <p><i>Background Information: all freshmen students are required to buy a meal plan for the entire year. Meal plans include blocks (which pay for the entire meal and can only be used once per time period) and dinex (which similar to a debit card that can only be used at CMU approved locations).</i></p>
        <p>Class: User Centered Research Evaluation</p>
        <p><b>Insights</b></p>
        <p>After conducting these tests, we were able to identify several key factors. To begin, students generally donâ€™t like the lunch experience. From our interview data, we found that students strongly value time, price, and health when deciding where to eat. They find campus locations to be inconveniently slow and inconsistent with their schedule. One thing we noticed was that the meal plan is a large factor in the lunch experience for undergrads. We saw that students stay on the meal plan for convenience, despites its flaws.</p>
        <p> In order to narrow down the problems associated with the lunch experience, we decided to focus on the meal plan and see how we could maximize its convenience and usefulness. We found this to be important as there is currently a lack of incentive for upperclassmen to stay on the meal plan, as paying with card or cash saves more money. Students already have enough factors causing stress in their lives, and by staying on the meal plan, they do not have to worry about cooking or travelling far to buy food.
        <p><b>Solution</b></p>
        <p>Our proposal is to implement a mobile app that allows users to order food provided by any on-campus dining locations and make payments on their phones. They can schedule orders online for a specific time and get alerts on their phones when the orders are ready without waiting in lines. The vendors receive orders from their systems and prepare food for customers. Customers then can just  tap or swipe their cards at a special pick up window to receive their food from a server. This app would only target meal plan users which would segment the flow of orders and people, as well as help retain users on the meal plan after their first year. Therefore, users can pay for the orders through their linked CMU meal plan account automatically.</p>
        <p><b>Report</b></p>
        <p>We conducted a survey to evaluate student opinions on the meal plan. We focused on identifying key values of eaters and how they change given time constraints. We wrote a report on our findings and their implications on our product.</p>

        <p>Note: we understand that our (statistical) results are not significant given the small sample size.</p>
        <p><b>Poster</b></p>
        <p>Our solution to the problems we identified. We focused on creating a (realistic) feasible solution that would benefit both the vendors and the consumers.</p>
        <p>The following poster was designed by a teammate.</p>
